Our wine glasses were never dry, and she instinctively sensed that it would be a three bottle sort of night and suggested additional bottles to go with our meal.\\n\\nThe food was of a generous proportion, so bear this in mind when ordering. My Fez Salad was fresh, crisp, and the combination of the dressing and goat cheese hit the spot. Our hummus platter was heaven-sent, and had just the right amount of garlic. The lamb kisra was also exceptional, and immediately devoured. The aforementioned Harissa fries were fiery and I often dream of them. No, really. If Fez was located in Tucson, I would gain at least ten pounds from just eating harissa fries every day.

You would have to remember us because we were the table that had 1/2 of a waiter. It was so nice of you to take the time to take our order and then let the waiter go home because he had been there since lunch. \\n\\nYou know what sucks more than working 2 shifts? How about being the last table for the guy who worked 2 shifts, it was so nice of the manager to let him leave, but hey how about taking the time to have someone FINISH the open orders? \\n\\nSimply the food was not good and you are over priced.\\n\\nBut the worst part is that your staff is just not good at their job, THEY DONT CARE and that is a result of MANAGEMENT not caring.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"stars\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5,\n          1,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
